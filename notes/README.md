# Learning Notes

This directory contains my personal notes, code experiments, and exercises while learning from the reference materials.

## Reference Materials

The reference books are Git submodules located in `/reference/`:
- `QuantFinanceBook` - BSD 3-Clause License
- `book_irds3` - GPL v3 License

## Structure

- `*.md` - Markdown notes on concepts
- `*.py` - Python code examples and experiments
- `experiments/` - Modified/extended versions for learning

## Notes

All code in this `notes/` directory is my own work for learning purposes. The reference materials remain unmodified in their respective submodules.
